react-native-application-practice
=================================

This is a simple messaging app written in React Native. I followed a tutorial
and wrote my own program so I could get my feet wet with React Native. I learned
through doing so that React Native is a powerful tool that makes cross platform
application development less challenging and manageable.

### Steps to test program:

  * Download the SDK for iOS and Android (Need a Mac for Xcode iPhone simulator)
  * Install React Native here: [React Native step-by-step download](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)
  * Use the steps in the React Native link to get the React Native project set
    up and ready to run. To do this, click the Get Started tab in the link.

*This application is not dynamic. Messages are stored currently within an array.
I plan to create a database that can store the messages sent back and forth by
different users.*
